#Rungle

Rungle is a small-scale, interpreted programming language based on a deterministic Turing Machine. The language works by using a series
of one character commands, which shift around values in a 30000 cell array of integers. Rungle extends the more basic Turing methods, by allowing you to add array cells to other array cells,
and more.
